Log of Project Changes

RESEARCH PHASE
March 25th - Project idea created
March 26th - Academic advisor at Columbia joined as oversight
March 31st to April 23rd - Started with GPT-JT and switched to bart-large-mnli as main-model for prototype

PROTOTYPE PHASE
April 24th - First prototype with bart-large-mnli and tosdr extracted data tested (bad results, see below)
April 25th - Added two collaborators to the project (had brainstorm meeting)
May 1st - Decided to use databases for storage of data to maximize speed (over json and csv)

BACKEND DEVELOPMENT & FRONTEND PROTOTYPE PHASE
May 5th - Created relevance labeling to generate training data for the classifier (hand labeled 600 sentences)
May 6th - Converted ml training data to csv format for ease of use with pandas and ml code
May 10th to May 23rd - Training started at 70% and moved to 87% for the relevance machine learning model (involved preprocessing to remove bad characters)
May 24th - ai1 for relevance classification hits 90% accuracy
May 26th to May 31st - Quote augmenting ml model implemented to create 100 examples of each case for training of case classifier ai (switched from chatgpt to parrot)
May 31st - First website design implemented at a test phase
June 1st to June 24th - Began training ai2 (pivoted from bart-large-mnli to bert-large-cased to bert-base-cased to bart-large-mnli)
June 22nd - Achieved 93% accuracy on ai2 case selection with 30 epochs over 15 hours of training
June 24th - Intensive testing on ai reveals faults, transition back to bart-large-mnli (semi accurate compared to tosdr, but very accurate in finding valid alternatives)

MATURE BACKEND & FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT PHASE
July 1st - New database code and format adopted for storing all ai results
July 2nd - Website design plan finalized
July 4th - Calculation code for new database shifted to softmax w/ multi_label as false
July 9th - Alpha service set selected (16 services, 88 policies), double mnli run gives promising 
July 10th - 404 page and frontend basics complete
July 17th - Alpha frontend pages and design finished and sql integration in progress
July 18th - Alpha database optimized and reduced from 280 mb to 40 mb on alpha service set
July 19th - Database successfully linked to services page (on local machine, issue w/ vercel deployment)
July 21st - About page and donation site created completed
July 25th - Prisma adopted as ORM to replace personal APIs

ALPHA PHASE
July 26th - Alpha launched!
July 28th - Contributors, roadmap, and hamburger menu added; service page redesigned
August 1st - Search and service function added through AWS PostgreSQL RDS attached by prisma
August 6th - volapyk.net domain secured and service page remodel

BETA PHASE
tbd - Beta launched!

PRODUCTION PHASE
tbd - Project launched!
